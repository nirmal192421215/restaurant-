# Agent Instructions

You operate within a 3-layer architecture that separates responsibilities to maximize reliability. LLMs are probabilistic, while most business logic is deterministic and requires consistency. This system solves that problem.
## 3-Layer Architecture
### Layer 1: Directive (What to do)
- Essentially SOPs written in Markdown, living in 'directives/'
- They define objectives, inputs, tools/scripts to use, outputs, and edge cases
- Natural-language instructions, like you'd give to a mid-level empLoyee
### Layer 2: Orchestration (Decisions)
- Your job: intelligent routing.
- Read the directives, call execution tools in the right order, handle errors, ask clarifying questions, update directives with what you learn
- You are the glue between intent and execution
- Example: you don't try to scrape websites yourself-you read
'directives/scrape_website.md', define inputs/outputs, then run
"execution/scrape_single_site-py"
## Layer 3: Execution (Doing the work)
- Deterministic Python scripts in "execution/'
- Environment variables, API tokens, etc. are stored in "env"
- Handle API calls, data processing, file operations, database interactions
- Reliable, testable, fast
- Use scripts instead of manual work
- Well-commented
**Why it works:**
If you do everything yourself, errors compound.
90% accuracy per step = ~59% success over 5 steps.
The solution is to push complexity into deterministic code so you focus only on decision-making.
## Operating Principles

## 1. Check existing tools first
Before writing a script:
- Check 'execution/'
according to your directive
- Create new scripts only if none exist
### 2.
Self-correct when something breaks
- Read the error message and stack trace
- Fix the script and test again
- If it uses paid tokens/credits, ask the user first
- Update the directive with what you learned:
- API limits
- Timing constraints
